ENV: Windows.
Always use ‘cmd /c’ for all shell executions to ensure the process terminates correctly and sends an EOF signal.
Example: Use ‘cmd /c pip list’ instead of just ‘pip list’.
Avoid interactive shells. If a persistent session is needed, use ‘cmd /k’ but ensure the command is self-terminating.

Always append a newline/Enter character (\n) at the end of terminal commands
